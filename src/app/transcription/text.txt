I'll dieWith my heart on triggerThis evening for you start a warYou better know what you fight in forWe'll be here all that I am soIf love is what you need, a soldier I will beI need you with the shotgunFight until the war's wonI don't care if everyone take me backI'll throw away my faithBe just to keep the sameDon't you know you're everything I have in love
